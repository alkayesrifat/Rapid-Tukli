# Rapid Tukli - Quick Note Extension

Rapid Tukli is a lightweight and user-friendly Chrome extension designed for taking quick notes directly in your browser. It allows you to jot down ideas, reminders, or any text-based content effortlessly. Your notes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after you close the browser.

## Features
- **Auto-Save**: Notes are automatically saved as you type.
- **Simple Interface**: A clean and minimal text area for distraction-free note-taking.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored in `localStorage`, so they remain accessible across browser sessions.
- **Customizable Height**: The text area dynamically adjusts its height based on the content.

## How It Works

1. **Usage**: Click on the Rapid Tukli icon in the browser toolbar to open the popup.
2. **Take Notes**: Start typing in the text area. Your notes are saved automatically as you type.
3. **Persistent Storage**: The notes are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so they are available even after closing and reopening the browser.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the popup interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the text area and ensuring a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the auto-save functionality and dynamic height adjustment.
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: For integrating the extension with the Chrome browser.
